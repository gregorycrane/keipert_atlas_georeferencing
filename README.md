# kiepert_atlas_georeferencing

This project to georeference several maps from the Kiepert Atlas was begun in the Summer of 2021 by Peter Nadel, Yilin Liu and Jesse Spear. 

In the `polygon_data` folder, you can find geojson files that encode the boundaries from the original paper map scans. In the `point_data folder`, you can find the points from the Pleiades Ancient Place Name Gazetteer (https://pleiades.stoa.org/) mapped to these boundaries. In the `original_images folder`, you can find all of the original scans that were georeferenced.
